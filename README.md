# My Portfolio Webpage

I've started creating my simple Portfolio Webpage little by little, and so far this is what it containes:

- Nav-bar with glowing effect
- Introduction header with a button to view my CV
- Minimal 'about me' section
- Project section: a grid container (projects I intend to finish during my online coding academy)
- Contact form using third party FormSubmit endpoint
- Footer with my social business-network links
